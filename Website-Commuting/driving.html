          <p>Commuting from Wicklow to Dublin via roads can be risky and frustratingly expensive although your commute will be quicker than all public transport methods bar trains. However rush-hour traffic can be very intense
          and can cause long delays and expensive fuel wastage. Parking up in Dublin can be very expensive also so unless your place of work has allocated parking you might find yourself paying large amounts just to park.
          Driving would most likely suit if you planned on lift sharing with multiple other as the split fuel cost can increase its appeal alongside the flexibility of getting to leave or go when you want.</p>
